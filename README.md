Hungry App_ a desktop application
using linked-list, list of restaturants, delivery agents, users are created and data for each list is read from files using file handling of csv files.This application allows user to select any one option out of 12 options(like delivery order,place order,cancel order,finding restaturants based on type/nearby area, any many more options).For each order placed by user an delivery agent is alloted to that order and delivers the order and frees the agent. A global Que(que data structure) is maintained for all orders placed by users and delivers the order according to que data structure.To assign a delivery agent to an order, a pointer to agent node is created in node defination of order node, as every time order is created pointer to agent node points to top of agent node and both moves one step ahead by ->next.
